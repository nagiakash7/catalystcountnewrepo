# catalystcountnewrepo project assignment

For database I have used db sqlite as there Postgresql is misbehaving with my computer. 

The requirements have been mentioned in the requirements.text file 

Please creaate virtual env(python -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>)and and install the requirements by 
command pip install -r requirementx.txt 

After that one needs to migrate the database 

python manage.py makemigrations 
python manage.py migrate 

and then one can run the server using python manage.py runserver

admin board credentials : username: admin password: admin

Here after running headover to (http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/)

then sign in using the above credentails then you can upload the csv in the profile path 

then you can filter the count of objects using 5 types of filter industry, state, country, year founded, city. 

I was not sure of keywords and employee so i have not added that filter. Rest have been added
